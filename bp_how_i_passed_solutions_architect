## Introduction

After roughly two months of dedicated study, I am thrilled to announce that I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam (SAA) with a score of 759! My journey involved a blend of structured learning, practical exercises, and rigorous practice tests. In this post, I'll share the resources and strategies that helped me succeed, hoping they might aid others on a similar path.

## Comparing to the Developer Associate Exam

The SAA exam felt a notch tougher than the AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA), primarily due to the broader spectrum of services covered. Here's a breakdown of the key AWS services that were heavily tested in the SAA exam:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Storage Gateway
- Auto Scaling
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- CloudFormation
- AWS Lambda, Simple Queue Service (SQS), and Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- AWS GuardDuty and AWS Shield

## Study Materials

Choosing the right study materials can make a significant difference in your exam preparation. Here are the resources that I found invaluable:

### 1. **Stephane Maarek's Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course**
   - **Platform:** [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/102CPBAkoZcVZUQHQ=/)
   - **Overview:** This comprehensive course includes over 340 lectures, totaling approximately 26 hours. Stephane Maarek does an excellent job explaining each service in detail, providing clear examples that are easy to remember. He explicitly highlights which topics will appear on the exam and offers hands-on lectures to reinforce the material.
   - **Note:** Some hands-on sessions may incur additional costs if you're using a free-tier account.

### 2. **Jon Bonso's Practice Exams**
   - **Platform:** [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/102DhnAkoZcVZUQHQ=/)
   - **Usefulness:** These practice exams are tough but closely mimic the complexity and depth of the actual exam questions. Initially, I scored between 40s and 60s, which was demotivating. However, after thoroughly reviewing each question and consulting the [TutorialsDojo AWS Cheat Sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/), my scores improved significantly.

### 3. **Whizlabs AWS Labs**
   - **Platform:** [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/)
   - **Features:** For those who prefer a more simulated lab environment, Whizlabs offers a token-based system to access their labs. This can be a bit pricey, but it's a worthwhile investment for hands-on learning.

## Study Schedule

Consistency was key in my preparation. I spent about 2 hours each weekday and between 2-4 hours on weekends studying. This schedule allowed me to complete Stephane's course in just under a month.

## Practice Makes Perfect

The practice exams provided by Jon Bonso were instrumental in my success. Despite failing all his practice tests initially, I managed to pass the DVA with an 873 previously and felt confident tackling the SAA. I revisited and retook the practice exams, focusing on understanding each question and the associated concepts thoroughly. This strategy boosted my scores to between 70s and 80s on subsequent attempts.

## Taking the Exam

I decided to take the exam despite not consistently scoring above 85 on the practice tests. This risk paid off, though I would recommend others ensure they are scoring at least 85+ if they prefer a safer margin.

## Conclusion

Passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam is a challenging but achievable goal. With the right resources, a consistent study plan, and thorough practice, you can also succeed. I hope my experience inspires and guides you through your own certification journey.

Thank you for reading, and best of luck if you're pursuing this certification!
