## Prerequisites: Setting Yourself Up for Success

Before tackling this advanced certification, I highly recommend having:

1. AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification
2. AWS Developer Associate certification
3. Practical experience building and managing systems on AWS

In my case, I had already obtained the AWS Solutions Architect Associate, AWS Developer Associate, and AWS Security Specialty certifications. This foundation, combined with my daily work as a cloud security engineer, significantly boosted my preparation for the DevOps Professional exam.

## My Study Resources: The Winning Combination

### 1. Udemy Course: AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional 2024

My primary study resource was Stefan Maarek's course on Udemy. Here's why I loved it:

- Comprehensive coverage of exam topics
- Detailed explanations of complex concepts
- Hands-on labs for practical experience
- About 20 hours of content

Stefan's teaching style is exceptional, making even the most challenging topics accessible. The course is a perfect blend of theory and practice, which is crucial for this exam.

### 2. Tutorials Dojo Cheat Sheets and Practice Exams

To complement the Udemy course, I heavily relied on Tutorials Dojo resources:

- **Cheat Sheets**: Concise, bullet-point summaries of key services and concepts
- **Practice Exams**: Closely mimic the actual exam, sometimes even more challenging

The combination of Stefan Maarek's course and Tutorials Dojo resources proved to be a powerful strategy for exam success.

## My Exam Day Experience: Lessons Learned

I chose to take my exam at a testing center, as I find it helps me focus better than testing from home. Here are some key takeaways from my exam day:

1. **Time Management is Crucial**: The 180 minutes go by quickly. I only had time to review about 20 out of 75 questions in the last 15 minutes.

2. **Question Complexity**: The questions are incredibly detailed. Be prepared for scenarios that require careful analysis.

3. **Physical Preparation**: I made the mistake of not eating properly or staying hydrated before the exam. This led to a terrible headache by the end. Learn from my error!

4. **Practice Elimination**: Given the time constraints, it's essential to practice the process of elimination during your prep.

5. **Exam Environment**: My testing center provided noise-canceling headphones, which were helpful for concentration.

## Tips for Exam Success

1. **Hands-on Experience**: Don't just rely on theoretical knowledge. Spend time in the AWS console implementing the concepts you learn.

2. **Use Practice Exams Wisely**: Treat them as learning tools, not just assessments. Review every question, right or wrong, to understand the reasoning.

3. **Focus on AWS Well-Architected Framework**: Many questions are based on real-world scenarios that align with AWS best practices.

4. **Understand Service Integrations**: The DevOps Pro exam often tests your knowledge of how different AWS services work together.

5. **Read Questions Carefully**: Given the detail in each question, make sure you understand what's being asked before answering.

6. **Stay Calm**: The exam is challenging, but remember that you've prepared well. Trust your knowledge and instincts.

## Final Thoughts: You Can Do It!

Passing the AWS Certified DevOps Professional exam in 60 days was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. It pushed me to deepen my understanding of AWS services and DevOps practices, skills that are invaluable in today's cloud-centric world.

Remember, everyone's journey is different. You might need more or less time depending on your background and experience. The key is consistent, focused study and plenty of hands-on practice.
