Hey there, cloud enthusiasts! It's Damien from the Dev Sec Blueprint (DSB), and today I'm excited to share my journey and insights on how to effectively pass the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) certification exam. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from prerequisites to study resources and exam tips. So, let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites: Setting the Foundation

Before we delve into the exam specifics, let's talk about prerequisites. If you're new to cloud computing or haven't worked with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services before, I highly recommend starting with the Google Cloud Digital Leader certification. Here's why:

1. It provides a broad overview of all Google Cloud services.
2. It builds a solid foundation for understanding cloud concepts.
3. It helps you familiarize yourself with the Google Cloud ecosystem.

I personally took this route before attempting the ACE exam, and I found it incredibly beneficial. However, if you already have cloud experience, perhaps with AWS or Azure certifications under your belt, you can skip the Digital Leader cert and jump straight into ACE preparation.

## Understanding the ACE Exam

Now, let's break down what the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification is all about. According to Google, an Associate Cloud Engineer is responsible for:

- Deploying and securing applications and services
- Implementing cloud infrastructure
- Monitoring operations across multiple projects
- Maintaining enterprise solutions to meet performance metrics

In essence, this certification validates your ability to:

1. Deploy, configure, and implement cloud solutions using GCP services
2. Set up and manage projects and accounts
3. Ensure successful operation of deployed solutions
4. Optimize and maintain cloud-based systems

### Exam Details

## Essential Study Resources

To prepare for the ACE exam, I relied on a combination of high-quality resources. Here are my top recommendations:

1. **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Course by Antoni Tzavelas**
   This free 20-hour course on YouTube (associated with freeCodeCamp) is an excellent starting point. Antoni does a fantastic job of explaining concepts, providing hands-on exercises, and covering all the essential topics. You'll learn how to:
   - Create Compute Engine VMs
   - Set up Cloud Storage buckets
   - Use the gcloud CLI
   - And much more!

   While the course is free on YouTube, I recommend purchasing it on the Exam Pro website for better progress tracking and access to practice exams.

2. **Practice Exams**
   To test your theoretical knowledge and exam readiness, I highly recommend:
   - Practice exams included with the Exam Pro course
   - TutorialDojo practice exams for ACE

3. **TutorialDojo Cheat Sheets**
   These concise, well-structured cheat sheets are perfect for quick reviews and filling knowledge gaps. They cover all the essential GCP services and concepts you'll need for the exam.

## My Study Schedule and Approach

I'll be honest â€“ my study schedule wasn't always consistent, which is why it took me about three months to prepare for the exam. Here's a breakdown of my journey:

- Late May to mid-July: Completed the ACE course
- Mid-July to late August: Focused on:
  - Reading through cheat sheets
  - Taking practice exams
  - Hands-on practice with GCP services

One of the most valuable experiences during my preparation was participating in the CloudResume API Challenge hosted by Rashab and Funny (I'll link their YouTube channels in the description). This challenge allowed me to apply what I had learned by creating an API that serves my resume in JSON format. It was an excellent way to gain practical experience with GCP services.

## Key Focus Areas for Exam Success

Based on my experience and the exam content, I recommend focusing on the following areas:

1. Cloud Functions
2. Billing and IAM (Identity and Access Management)
3. App Engine
4. Deployment Manager
5. Cloud Run
6. GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and Kubernetes fundamentals
7. gcloud CLI (Command Line Interface)
8. Dataproc
9. BigTable
10. Firestore
11. Cloud RDS
12. Cloud Spanner
13. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
14. Cloud DNS

Make sure you have a solid understanding of these services and concepts, as they form the core of what you'll be tested on in the exam.
