# Introduction

Hey there, Damien here from DevSecBlueprint! In today’s blog post, we will be diving into DAST scanning with OWASP ZAP and Docker. If you’re just starting out with Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), I highly recommend watching my previous video on SAST and DAST concepts to lay down a foundational understanding. 

Without further ado, let’s get right into the topic at hand.

## Prerequisites
Before we get started with the nuts and bolts of OWASP ZAP and Docker, there are a couple of prerequisites that need to be installed on your local machine:

1. **Docker**: We will be running OWASP ZAP in a Docker container.
2. **Git**: Required for cloning repositories.
3. **VS Code (Optional)**: It’s a helpful IDE for managing your code and version control history.

Having these installed will make the process smoother and more efficient.

## What is OWASP ZAP?
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a highly popular open-source penetration testing tool designed to help developers and security professionals find vulnerabilities in their web applications. 

### Key Features:
- Identifies a wide range of vulnerabilities, including those within the OWASP Top 10 such as security misconfigurations, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
- Capable of both **Active** and **Passive** scans.

### Active vs Passive Scans
Active and passive are two types of scanning modes in ZAP:
- **Passive Scans**: These scans check the HTTP request application's response for known indicators without attempting to penetrate the application.
- **Active Scans**: These scans actively inject requests that test for vulnerabilities, and are more effective but pose a risk of taking down the application.

It’s recommended to use passive scans in a production environment to minimize risk.

## Docker Basics
Docker is a platform that allows us to package and run applications in an isolated environment called a container. This isolation offers several benefits, including security, ease of deployment, and the ability to run multiple containers simultaneously.

### Key Concepts:
- **Container**: A lightweight standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run the application.
- **Dockerfile**: A text document containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Image**: A read-only template used to create Docker containers.

## Setup Instructions

### Cloning the Repository
First, you’ll need to clone the **TWAPP** web application repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-URL>
cd <cloned-repo-directory>
```

### Spinning Up the Environment
We will use Docker Compose to set up the necessary environment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, but if you want to see real-time logs, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Verifying the Setup
To ensure the environment is up and running, navigate to `http://localhost` in your web browser.

### Executing the Scan
Now, let’s run an OWASP ZAP scan using Docker. The following command mounts your current directory to the Docker container and runs a full active scan:

For Windows:
```powershell
docker run -v %cd%:/zap/wrk/:rw --network="host" owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t http://localhost -g gen.conf 
```
For Mac/Linux:
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw --network="host" owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t http://localhost -g gen.conf 
```

This command will:
1. Mount your current directory to the container.
2. Allow the ZAP Docker container to interact with your localhost.
3. Perform a full active scan and generate a report.

This process may take some time, so be patient.

## Understanding the Scan Report
Once the scan is complete, you’ll find the generated report in HTML format:

```bash
ls zap_report.html
```

Open `zap_report.html` in a web browser:

### Interpreting the Report
The report will provide a summary of the identified alerts, their risk levels, and instances. Here are a few common vulnerabilities you might find:

- **SQL Injection**:
  - **Risk Level**: High
  - **Description**: Application source code disclosed due to improper handling of user inputs.
  - **Solution**: Ensure proper sanitization and parameterization of SQL queries.

- **Application Error Disclosure**:
  - **Risk Level**: Medium
  - **Description**: Error messages disclosing sensitive information.
  - **Solution**: Suppress or customize error messages to avoid revealing internal details.
