In today's blog post, I'm going to provide you with some invaluable tips and tricks on how to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. This certification is AWS's most popular and serves as an important entry-level certification for aspiring cloud engineers. As someone who has earned and actively leveraged this certification for the past few years, I'll share some insights to help you effectively pass this exam.

## Recommended Resources

### Stephane Maarek's Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course

**Note:** Be cautious when participating in hands-on labs, as running AWS resources can incur costs. Always terminate resources when you're done to avoid unexpected bills.

### Tutorial Dojo's Practice Exams

I highly recommend Tutorial Dojo's practice exams to reinforce your knowledge. These exams are quite similar, if not more challenging, than the actual exam. Accompanying cheat sheets further fill in any gaps in your understanding of each AWS service.

## Study Strategy

When I was preparing for the exam, I dedicated about two hours each workday and two to four hours on weekends to studying. I followed these steps:

1. **Complete Stephane Maarek's Course:** Took comprehensive notes and referenced tutorial sheets.
2. **Practice Exams:** Consistently scored between 70% and 80% on Tutorial Dojo's practice exams.
3. **Labs and Exercises:** Used Whizlabs for practical labs.

> **Pro Tip:** Aim to consistently score 80% or above on practice exams before scheduling your real exam. If you're under 80%, consider rescheduling your exam to focus on knowledge gaps.
