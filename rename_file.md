# Mastering the AWS Security Specialty Exam: Tips, Resources, and More

What's going on, y'all? This is Damien from the DevSecBlueprint once again, and in today's blog post, I'm going to give you guys some tips on how to pass the AWS Security Specialty exam. Aside from the DevOps Professional Certification exam, this is the second hardest exam, in my opinion, and I believe that sharing my expertise and experiences with the resources that I'm going to highlight will help y'all pass this exam. So without further ado, let's get right into it.

## Prerequisites: AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate

Alright, so before I go and explain the exam and get into all the other things that you should use to prepare for it, I will say this. In order for you to successfully pass the exam, I would highly recommend that you at least have the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate**. The key reason why I say this is because the exam itself is really built on top of the foundational knowledge that you would get if you take the solutions architect associate. That was the advice that I received before I sat for this exam, and I came out passing it on the first try. So I would highly recommend that you guys do the exact same thing.

## Understanding the Exam

Let's talk a little bit about the exam itself now. According to AWS's website, the AWS security specialty certification exam validates your expertise in creating and implementing security solutions within the AWS cloud. So the thing about the certification is that it's going to validate and confirm your understanding of specialized data classifications, data protections, and various architectures on how to implement security controls within AWS.

You can also learn how to secure production deployments and make trade-off decisions regarding cost, security, and deployment complexity while meeting application requirements that are specified by your business.

### Exam Structure
This particular exam has:
- **65 questions** that are either multiple choice or multiple response.
- **Duration:** 170 minutes, nearly three hours.
- **Cost:** About 300 USD.
- **Testing Options:** You can test online at home or go to a testing center that uses Pearson VUE.

For more detailed information about the exam itself, you can find the link to the [AWS exam guide](insert-link-here).

## Preparation Resources

Now that you guys have an understanding of what the exam is and where the exam guide is, let's talk about some of the preparation resources that you should review.

### 1. Ultimate AWS Certified Security Specialty Course by Stefan Mark

For starters, the ultimate AWS certified security specialty course created by **Stefan Mark** is one of the highest-rated courses out there for this exam. If you don't know much about Stefan, let me tell you this, the guy is a legend. I've used his course material for almost every AWS certification that I have. Stefan is very good at breaking down complex concepts while being concise in his delivery. In addition to that, his course is about 16 hours of on-demand videos and recordings, and he also includes hands-on labs that you can do with him.

Just know that, of course, it's going to cost you a little bit of money to leverage or use some of the services that are in scope for this exam.

### 2. AWS Security Specialty Focus Labs by Whizlabs

The next thing I recommend would be the **AWS Security Specialty Focus Labs** created by *Whizlabs*. The reason why I'm saying this is because the majority of the questions on the exam are going to really be based on how much hands-on experience you have. They have about 54 hands-on labs that you can take to increase your skills that range across all of the key domains on the exam, like threat detection and incident response, infrastructure security monitoring, and IAM. You can choose whichever section you really want to focus on and just go crazy lapping.

The only thing about this is that the hands-on labs themselves aren't free. Of course, you do have to purchase them, and the initial price for them is 65.95 USD. Sometimes Whizlabs does have sales, so hopefully, you can catch one and save yourself some money.

### 3. Tutorial Dojo's Practice Exams and Cheat Sheets

Along with the course and Whizlabs, I also recommend that you go and purchase **Tutorial Dojo's practice exams** and reference their cheat sheets when you're studying for the exam. Tutorial Dojo's cheat sheets are exceptionally detailed and really cover all of the necessary points for each of the services that are in scope. On top of that, the practice exams themselves are quite close to the actual exam, if not harder than the actual exam. So if you purchase these practice exams, you'll want to consistently take them until you reach a high score like the high eighties. If you're constantly obtaining 80 percent or above on the practice exams, then I am definitely certain that you will pass the security specialty.

### 4. Becky Weiss's Talk

The last thing I recommend you guys take a look at is a talk given by **Becky Weiss**. In this particular talk, she covers the basics of network security, the process of reading and writing access management policies, and also data encryption. What I like about her is that she's really good at breaking down and explaining all these concepts in a way that anyone can understand. So make sure y'all watch that.

## Key Services to Focus On

Before you sit for the exam, I would highly recommend you pay attention to the following services. I'm almost certain you'll see these services very frequently on the exam. Make sure you study them in great detail:

- **CloudWatch**
- **CloudTrail**
- **KMS**
- **IAM**
- **GuardDuty**
- **Inspector**
- **Organizations**
- **Macie**
- **WAF**
- **Shield**
- **Security Hub**
- **Detective**
- **VPC**
- **Config**
- **Systems Manager**
