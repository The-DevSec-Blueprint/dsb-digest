## Why It's Essential to Start with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate

First things first, if you’re aiming for the AWS Security Specialty certification, I highly recommend having the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate under your belt. The foundational knowledge you gain from the Solutions Architect Associate is crucial. It not only prepares you with the basic principles of AWS architecture but also makes the uphill climb of the Security Specialty exam smoother.
