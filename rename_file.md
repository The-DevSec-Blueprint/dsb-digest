# How I Conquered the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional Exam in 60 Days

Hello everyone, Damien here from DevSecBlueprint, and I'm excited to share my journey on successfully passing the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exam in just 60 days. My hope is that by sharing my experience, resources, study plan, and some crucial tips, I can help you navigate your way to acing this challenging certification.

First off, this exam is no small feat. It's designed for individuals who are engaged in a DevOps engineer role, focusing on operating, managing, and provisioning distributed application systems on the AWS platform. This certification validates your technical expertise in continuous delivery systems, methodologies on AWS, security controls automation, and much more.

## Understanding the Exam

Before diving deep into my study plan and the resources I used, let's get a brief overview of what this exam entails. The AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exam is recognized as one of the more challenging tests compared to other AWS professional level exams. It takes 180 minutes, costs $300 USD, and comprises 75 questions, either multiple choice or multiple response.

### Why This Certification?

Pursuing this certification was a deliberate move on my part. With several other AWS certifications under my belt, I felt this was the logical next step. The knowledge gained from this certification is invaluable for anyone looking to implement highly scalable, high-availability applications on AWS.

## Prerequisites and Preparations

Let me be candid—this exam is difficult. I strongly recommend having one of the associate-level certifications (either AWS Solutions Architect Associate or AWS Developer Associate) before attempting this one. Additionally, hands-on experience with AWS is crucial.

### Resources Used

1. **Udemy Course by Stefan Marek**: This was my primary resource. Stefan's detailed explanations and hands-on approach were instrumental in helping me grasp complex concepts.

2. **Tutorials Dojo Cheat Sheets**: A fantastic, free resource that provides summaries of various AWS services. These cheat sheets are great for quick revisions.

I also leveraged the Tutorials Dojo practice exams, which mimic the difficulty level of the actual exam, providing both a challenge and a solid learning opportunity.

### My Study Schedule

My study plan was rigorous but effective:

- **First 30 Days**: I dedicated two hours on weekdays and doubled that on weekends to Stefan Marek’s Udemy course. This allowed me to absorb the content without rushing, with ample time for hands-on practice.
- **Next 30 Days**: I shifted my focus to reviewing Tutorials Dojo's cheat sheets and taking multiple practice exams a week. This helped identify gaps in my knowledge and solidify what I had learned.

Remember, consistency is key. Adjust the schedule based on your pace of learning but ensure you are regularly dedicating time to your study plan.

### Emphasized Services

From my experience, certain AWS services played a significant role in the exam. Pay extra attention to:

- CloudFormation
- CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy
- Lambda, API Gateway
- Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose
- Systems Manager (Session Manager and Patch Manager, in particular)

These are just a few, but understanding these services deeply will be highly beneficial.

## Testing Experience and Tips

When test day arrived, I chose to take the exam at a testing center, which I find more conducive to focusing. One piece of advice - hydrate and eat well before the exam. Trust me, it makes a difference.

During the exam, you’ll find that time management and the process of elimination are your best strategies. The questions are detailed, which can be time-consuming. Practice pacing yourself with practice exams to optimize your performance.

## Conclusion

Finally, stepping out of the exam, despite the challenges, I knew all the hard work had paid off. It was a fulfilling journey, one that elevated my understanding and skills on the AWS platform.

For those of you embarking on this journey, I hope my experience sheds some light and guides you towards achieving your certification. Remember, the path may seem daunting, but with the right resources, a solid study plan, and perseverance, you too can conquer the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exam.
