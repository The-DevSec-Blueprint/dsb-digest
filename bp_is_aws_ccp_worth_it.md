## Introduction

After pursuing various comments across social media platforms regarding the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) certification, I felt compelled to share my perspective on the value of obtaining this certification.

## Is It Worth It?

So, on to answer the key question of this entire blog post. _**Is the CCP truly worth it?**_

In my opinion, the worth of pursuing the AWS CCP certification hinges on your aspirations and existing cloud knowledge. If you aim to specialize in AWS and pursue associate-level certifications, then the CCP is a definite yes. However, if you seek to become a cloud generalist, CompTIA's Cloud+ certification may be a better fit as it covers fundamental cloud concepts applicable across various platforms.

## My Experience

Before undertaking the AWS Certified Developer - Associate (CDA) certification, I opted to take the CCP exam. Priced at a reasonable $100, the CCP ensures a solid grasp of cloud principles, AWS billing and pricing, AWS security, and an overview of AWS services. With a duration of approximately 90 minutes, it's arguably the easiest AWS certification exam available.

I strongly recommend it for individuals with minimal cloud experience intending to pursue associate-level certifications, as it serves as an excellent foundation. However, be prepared for a steep learning curve if you dive into associate-level exams without prior cloud knowledge.

## Study Materials

For those interested, based on my experience and research, I have some study material recommendations to help you prepare for the exam:

1. [**ACloudGuru's AWS CCP CLF-C02 Course**](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02): The course provides comprehensive coverage of all knowledge areas outlined in the exam guide, encompassing the four domains: Cloud Concepts, Security and Compliance, Cloud Technology and Services, and Billing, Pricing, and Support.

1. [**TutorialsDojo Practice Exams**](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/14637/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-official-practice-exam-clf-c02-english): This is the AWS official practice exam for the CCP! I think this is sufficient enough for you to test your knowledge. No need for third-party curatied exams.

ACloudGuru has consistently proven to be a valuable resource for AWS exams and labs. The recommended course typically takes around a week to complete, offering approximately 22 hours of content with hands-on labs to familiarize you with the AWS console, especially billing services.

While the practice exam incurs a fee of approximately $14.99, it's a worthwhile investment as it closely resembles the actual exam.

## Exam Experience

When test day arrived, I chose to take the exam at a testing center, which I find more conducive for focusing. I tend to go to the testing center for all of my certification exams.

**Unlike any other certification exams I've taken, the CCP exam is relatively straightforward; you either know the answer.... or you don't.**

Unlike other exams where you must assess multiple services and select the optimal solution, the CCP exam requires more straightforward knowledge recall or answers. However, this simplicity has its merits, ultimately sparing candidates from excessive head-banging against the proverbial wall!

## Study Plan

With consistent effort of course study about 3-4 hours per day, along with taking practice exams post-course completion, candidates can typically pass the exam within 2-3 weeks.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the value of the AWS CCP certification depends on your background and objectives. If you seek to delve deeper into AWS without compromising on cloud fundamentals, the CCP is a worthwhile investment. Otherwise, consider redirecting your $100 towards something that aligns better with your goals or exploring alternative cloud certifications.

Thank you for reading, and I wish you the best of luck if you decide to take this exam. Until next time, happy studying, and I'll see you in the cloud!
